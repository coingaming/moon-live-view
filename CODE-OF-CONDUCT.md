# Code of Conduct
## Preamble

Moon is Yolo Group's product design system that helps us maintain the integrity of our user experience and optimize design and development resources. This is made possible by the support and hard work of Moon Live's core team, including those who contribute to and use the Moon Design system.

This document offers some guidance to ensure everyone can cooperate effectively in a positive and inspiring atmosphere and to explain how to support each other.

This code of conduct is mandatory for users who engage with Moon Live's core team, including those who contribute.

## Overview

This Code of Conduct presents a summary of Yolo's values and "common sense". The basic social ingredients that hold our project together include:

- Be respectful
- Be collaborative
- Be pragmatic
- Support others in the community
- Get support from others in the community

Our project is made up of several groups of individuals and organizations which can roughly be divided into three groups:

- Moon Core team.
- Contributors, or those who add value to the project by improving the design system.
- Users / Projects, or those who add value to the project through their support as consumers.

This Code of Conduct reflects the agreed standards of behavior for anybody. The Moon team acts according to the standards written down in this Code of Conduct and will defend these standards for the benefit of the community. The Moon Core team will exercise the right to suspend access to any person who persistently breaks our shared Code of Conduct.

### Be respectful

In order for the project to stay healthy, its members must feel comfortable and accepted. Treating one another with respect is absolutely necessary for this. In a disagreement, in the first instance, assume that people mean well.

We do not tolerate personal attacks, racism, sexism, or any other form of discrimination. Disagreement is inevitable from time to time, but respect for the views of others will go a long way toward earning respect for your own view. Respecting other people, their work, their contributions, and assuming well-meaning motivation. We expect members of our community to be respectful when dealing with other contributors, users, and projects.

### Be collaborative

At Moon Live, we value collaboration as the foundation of our design system library. We believe in an inclusive and supportive environment where all contributors can express themselves. When engaging with the Moon Live project, we encourage open communication, respect for diverse perspectives, and a willingness to listen and learn from one another. Whether you're suggesting improvements, reporting issues, or contributing code, remember to embrace teamwork and consider the collective goals of our project.

### Be pragmatic

Because of its nature, the Moon Live project is pragmatic. We value tangible results and consistency over having the last word in a discussion. We are open to suggestions and welcome solutions regardless of their origin, openly discussed.

### Support others / Get Support

Our small community is made strong by mutual respect and collaboration, responsible behavior. Sometimes, there are situations where other community members need help.

Technical disagreements happen all the time. Our project is no exception to the rule. The goal is not to avoid disagreements or differing views but to resolve them constructively using the RFC (Request For Comment) process. You should turn to the community to seek advice and to resolve disagreements and, where possible, consult the code team directly involved in the process.
